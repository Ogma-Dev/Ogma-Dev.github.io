&lt;p&gt;I'm James; I currently work for a large company where, without getting too long-winded, I look after a lot of data, produce data reports, run simulations and write software to help the team I belong to produce reports/simulations in a more efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always grown up around technology. My dad worked for a networking company back when I was a kid in the 90's, and was always brining home bits of old computers, modems, weird storage &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; etc. I'd often go scavenging in the loft, where inevitably the cast-offs were stowed away for... well, "the future" as every male is accustomed to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my interest in programming began not long after getting the internet. I'm not sure how, but I stumbled into &lt;a href="http://www.sdf.org"&gt;SDF&lt;/a&gt;, a free UNIX shell account service from the 80's, where I tumbled down a rabbit hole of this magical new world of UNIX, telnet, SSH, IRC channels... All of it intrigued me from a ripe young age.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still being young I quite predictably loved video games, and inside this tavern of curiosity that was &lt;a href="http://www.sdf.org"&gt;SDF&lt;/a&gt; there was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD"&gt;MUD&lt;/a&gt;. I was instantly hooked. I started off playing with clients to automate some of my inputs, then moved into looking at the game's codebase. I ended up changing bits then wrote a few snippets, and hence began my adventures into the world of programming...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>personal</category><guid>https://ogma-dev.github.io/posts/about-me/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2016 23:39:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
